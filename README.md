# Review Scripture
### Scripture Memory Verse Validator

Live Site: [reviewscripture.netlify.app](reviewscripture.netlify.app)

Welcome to my project: Review Scripture, a scripture memory verse validator to help God's people hide his word in their hearts. This was a mini project used to introduce React to beginners learning web-application development for the Uni Navigators Computer Training Programme, Fall 2022. 

I have since taken over the code base and plan to extend the application's function to serve a wider audience. Here are some verses from the bible that strengthened my conviction for this project! I hope they will encourage you too! 

In the book of Jeremiah, Chapter 31, God declares: 

> This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time", declares the Lord. "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbour, or say to one another 'Know the Lord', because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest," declares the Lord. "For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more" - Jeremiah 31:33-34 (NIV 11)
> 

In the book of Psalm, Chapter 119, the Psalmist writes:
> How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. - Psalm 119:9,11 (NIV 84)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
